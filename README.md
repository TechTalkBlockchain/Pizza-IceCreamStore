# üçï PizzaIceStore NairaToken (NGT) && PizzaToken (PZT) Contract

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a decentralized application that involves purchasing pizza and ice cream using a custom token (`PizzaToken`) while allowing users to swap with a Naira-backed token (`NairaToken`). The contracts are deployed on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain using Hardhat Ignition, and users can interact with the system via Solidity smart contracts.

### Key Features
- **PizzaToken (`PZT`)**: A custom token that represents the value used for pizza and ice cream purchases.
- **NairaToken (`NGT`)**: A token that simulates the Naira currency.
- **PizzaIceStore Contract**: Manages the purchase of pizza and ice cream, and supports swapping between tokens.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

- **Swapping Tokens**: Use the `PizzaIceStore` contract to swap `NairaToken` for `PizzaToken` to purchase pizza or ice cream.
- **Purchase Items**: Call the `purchasePizza()` or `purchaseIceCream()` functions from the `PizzaIceStore` contract.
